# DecodeBengali
Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification Kaggle competition

We tried quite a few models for this competition: CNN, ResNet, EfficientNet, SeNet, Dense121 etc. Below is part of the code that was run in GCP virtual instance. We also trained our models on Google Colab. 

prep.ipynb: starter code for our baseline model, a plain vanilla CNN.   
eda.ipynb: summary statistics for the dataset.    
dense121.ipynb: training code for our dense121 model.    
EfficientNet folder: training code for our EfficientNet model.
